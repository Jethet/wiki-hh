## JSX in React

* All JSX code needs to be wrapped in one outer div to be returned as one return element of a component.
* JavaScript code in JSX needs to be inside {} brackets.
* You can use `className=` to set a condition, for example styling: `className={this.props.variable ? 'red-text' : 'blue-text'}`
