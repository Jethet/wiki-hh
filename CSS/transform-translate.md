## CSS transform-translate transformation property

CSS translate moves an element from its current position **up and down or side-to-side**:  
* By indicating one value, you move the element to the right side. Negative values move elements to the left.
* The second value moves the element down. Negative values move elements up.

The CSS `translateY` and `translateX` properties are a bit more specific. The elements move along either the horizontal or vertical axis.

With the **CSS transform property** you can use the following transformation methods:  
* translate(): The following example moves the element 50 pixels to the right, and 100 pixels down from its current position:
  ```css
    div {
      transform: translate(50px, 100px);
    }
  ```
* rotate()
* scaleX()
* scaleY()
* scale()
* skewX()
* skewY()
* skew()
* matrix()
