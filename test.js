## Code for the project To Do app with React

This is a private repo because we want our students to write the code themselves as much as possible. Only the coaches have access to private repos in this GitHub organisation.

The code in this repo is an example solution. Suggestions are always welcome (henriette@migracode.org).

/* README project
## Project To Do app

### The goal of this project is to practice working with React

We will be using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React

**Basic functionality:** 


1. Create a React app using `npx create-react-app project-todo-app`
1. Delete the css from the App.css file and use this file for your css
1. Delete the code in the App.js file between `<div className="App">` and the closing `</div>`
1. Create a folder called `components` in the src folder
1. Create a new file and create a function component called ToDo, with a field for the title and a text area for the to do description (you can use the extension .jsx instead of .js)
1. Create a new file and create a function component called ToDoOverview (this will show all to do cards on the page)
1.
