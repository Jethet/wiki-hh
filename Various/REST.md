**Representational State Transfer**, or REST, describes an architectural style for web services.  
REST consists of a set of standards or constraints for sharing data between different systems, and systems that implement REST are known as RESTful.  

REST is an abstract concept, not a language, framework, or type of software.  

Six guiding constraints define the REST architecture, as follows:

1. Uniform Interface: The interface of components must be the same. This means using the URI standard to identify resourcesâ€”in other words, paths that could be entered into the browser's location bar.
1. Client-Server: There is a separation of concerns between the server, which stores and manipulates data, and the client, which requests and displays the response.
1. Stateless Interactions: All information about each request is contained in each individual request and does not depend on session state.
1. Cacheable: The client and server can cache resources.
1. Layered System: The client can be connected to the end server, or an intermediate layer such as a load-balancer.
1. Code on Demand (Optional): A client can download code, which reduces visibility from the outside.
