# Content Delivery Network (CDN)
A CDN is a system of geographically distributed servers that work together to provide fast delivery of Internet content. It's designed to minimize latency in loading web pages by reducing the physical distance between the server and the user. A CDN allows for a quick transfer of assets needed to load content such as HTML pages, javascript files, stylesheets, images, and videos.  
A well-configured CDN can also help protect against common malicious attacks such  
as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. Over half of all internet traffic  
is served by CDNs.

**How a CDN works**  
To minimize distance between visitors and the website's server, a CDN stores a cached  
version of its content in multiple geographic locations known as the points of presence  
(PoP). Each PoP contains caching servers designed to deliver content to visitors within  
its proximity.  
For example, a visitor in the United States wishing to view content that originates  
from a UK-based server will have to deal with slow loading times if the request has to  
travel across the Atlantic Ocean. To eliminate the latency a CDN will store the content  
in a local United States PoP.
