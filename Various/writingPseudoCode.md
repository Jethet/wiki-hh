# How to write pseudo-code

1. Arrange the sequence of tasks and write the pseudocode accordingly.  
1. Start with the statement of pseudo code which establishes the main goal or the aim.  
**Example:** This program will allow the user to check whether a number is even or odd.  
1. The way the `if else`, `for`, `while` loops are indented in a program, indent the statements likewise. This helps  
to comprehend the decision control and execution mechanism. It also improves the readability to a great extent.
1. Use appropriate naming conventions. If a programmer goes through a pseudo code, their approach will follow  
what they see, so the naming must be simple and distinct.
1. Use appropriate sentence casings, such as CamelCase for methods, upper case for constants and lower case  
for variables.
1. Elaborate everything that is going to happen in the actual code. Don’t make the pseudo code abstract.
1. Use standard programming structures such as `if then`, `for`, `while`, `cases`.
1. Check whether all the sections of a pseudo code is complete, finite and clear to understand.
1. Don’t write the pseudo code in a complete programmatic manner. It must be simple to understand even for a  
layman or client, so don’t incorporate too many technical terms.
