# How to write a Pseudo-code?

1. Arrange the sequence of tasks and write the pseudocode accordingly.  
1. Start with the statement of a pseudo code which establishes the main  
goal or the aim.  
**Example:** This program will allow the user to check the number whether  
it's even or odd.  
1. The way the if-else, for, while loops are indented in a program, indent the  
statements likewise, as it helps to comprehend the decision control and  
execution mechanism. They also improve the readability to a great extent.
1. Use appropriate naming conventions. The human tendency follows the approach to  
follow what we see. If a programmer goes through a pseudo code, his approach will  
be the same as per it, so the naming must be simple and distinct.
1. Use appropriate sentence casings, such as CamelCase for methods, upper case for  
constants and lower case for variables.
1. Elaborate everything which is going to happen in the actual code. Don’t make the  
pseudo code abstract.
1. Use standard programming structures such as ‘if-then’, ‘for’, ‘while’, ‘cases’  
the way we use it in programming.
1. Check whether all the sections of a pseudo code is complete, finite and clear  
to understand and comprehend.
1. Don’t write the pseudo code in a complete programmatic manner. It is necessary  
to be simple to understand even for a layman or client, hence don’t incorporate  
too many technical terms.
